## I. Introduction

In scenarios such as search and rescue, firefighting, or bomb detonation, controlling a robot's movement through obstacles can be challenging. This project addresses this issue by utilizing stereo cameras for depth estimation and RRT for optimal path planning. The combination of these techniques provides a systematic approach to navigating complex environments.

## Usage

1. **Stereo Camera Setup and Calibration:**

    - Connect your stereo camera setup.
    - Run the `saveimages.py` script:

        ```bash
        python saveimages.py
        ```

    - Press 's' to save images for calibration for both left and right matrices.

    - Run the `stereocalibration.py` script:

        ```bash
        python stereocalibration.py
        ```

        - Check if your images are saved in the same resource folder. If not, declare the correct path in the script.

2. **Obstacle Detection:**

    - Run the `obstacledetection.py` script:

        ```bash
        python obstacledetection.py
        ```

        - This will find and locate obstacles and estimate their depth.

3. **Path Planning with RRT:**

    - Run the `main.py` script for RRT path planning:

        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```
